## Project 1 

## Introduction to the subject matter you are investigating: 
I am investigating how wage gaps between union and nonunion workers affect compensation strategies in human resources management. This is important because compensation influences an employee's overall satisfaction, retention, and performance.

## Research Question: 
How has the union–nonunion wage gap changed across different industries from 1973 to 2024, and what implications does this have for compensation strategies in human resources management?

## Description of how the data was originally collected (not how you found it, how the original curator of the data collected it): 
The data was originally collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) through the Current Population Survey (CPS). For high earning individuals, researchers used Pareto distribution estimates. Annually on Unionstats.com, linear regression models are used to demonstrate the wage gaps between union and nonunion workers.

## The motivation for your research question (citing relevant literature): 
My motivation for my research question is the recent terms of events and financial security for all. In “BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s grim recession warning: Trump tariffs ‘beyond anything I could have imagined’”, Ariel Zilber explains Larry Fink’s warning that fears of a potential recession could lead to unemployment for many.

## Describe the data set you wish to explore: 
I wish to explore union and non union workers across their highest education, industry, gender, and whether their profession is in a public or private sector.

## Describe observations in the data: 
The data spans from 1973 to 2024 and consists of union and nonunion workers.

## General descriptions of the variables: There are 10 variables: 
year, union membership, coverage, density, employment, gender, highest education, private or public sector, and industry.
