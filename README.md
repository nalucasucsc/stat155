# Union Membership Trends by Demographics and Industry: 1973â€“2024
---
# Research Question: How has union membership differed between gender, sector, industry, and education from 1973 to 2024?
---
# Description: 
This project investigates how union membership rates differ across education levels, industries, gender, and employment sectors from 1973 to 2024. Using longitudinal data, the analysis explores demographic and labor market factors associated with union participation, providing insight into trends and disparities over time.

The study analyzes datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics, published on UnionStats.com. Key demographic factors include education level, gender, industry type, and public vs. private sector employment. The analysis focuses on how these factors relate to union membership rates, using exploratory data analysis and logistic regression modeling.

The final product will include reproducible data analysis and a written summary of insights, helping to inform discussions around labor organization trends and workforce representation in the modern economy.
