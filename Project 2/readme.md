# Project 2
---
# Research Question:
How has union membership changed across different industries and demographics from 1977 to 2024?

---
# Analysis Objective
# Description: 
The objective of this analysis is to summarize and vizualize union membership trends over time, across sectors (private vs. public), industries (manufatcoring, wholesale and trade retail, public administration), gender (female vs. male), and education (more than college vs. less than college). Time-series plots and group-wise averages will be analyzed to reveal any trends and disparities. 
# Analysis:
I will be quantifying the relationship between union membership and demographics (industry, sector, gender, education, year) using linear regression. 
# Prediction:
I will be using logistic regression to find how industry, gender, sector, and highest education effect total employment, and total members. 
# Main variables of interest:
* year: year of observation 
* industry, sector, gender, highest education: main categories for union presence indicators and total employement (in 1,000's)

# Data Description:
The data was originally collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) through the Current Population Survey (CPS). For high earning individuals, researchers used Pareto distribution estimates. Annually on Unionstats.com, linear regression models are used to demonstrate the wage gaps between union and nonunion workers. You can find the data at https://www.unionstats.com/ under "By Sector and Demographic Group: 1973-2024". The dataset spans from 1973 to 2024, with this analysis focusing on the period from 1977 to 2024.
