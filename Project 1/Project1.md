## Project 1 
---
## Introduction to the subject matter you are investigating: 
I am investigating how union membership differs bewteen gender, sector, industry, and education from 1973 to 2024.

## Research Question: 
How has union membership changed across different industries and demographics from 1973 to 2024?

## Description of how the data was originally collected (not how you found it, how the original curator of the data collected it): 
The data was originally collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) through the Current Population Survey (CPS). For high earning individuals, researchers used Pareto distribution estimates. Annually on Unionstats.com, linear regression models are used to demonstrate the wage gaps between union and nonunion workers. You can find the data at https://www.unionstats.com/ under "By Sector and Demographic Group: 1973-2024". To access "Private Sector Wage & Salary" data click the excel sheet corressponding to "All". To access "Public Sector Wage & Salary" data click the excel sheet corresponding to "All". To access "Less Than College" data, click the excel under Demographic Groups. To access "College or More" data, click the excel under Demographic Groups. To access "Female" data, click the excel under Demographic Groups. To access "Male" data, click the excel under Demographic Groups. To access "Public Administration" data, click the excel under All Wage & Salary. To access "Wholesale/Retail" data, click the excel under All Wage & Salary. To access "Manufacturing" data, click the excel under All Wage & Salary.

## The motivation for your research question (citing relevant literature): 
In light of recent whistleblower allegations regarding the unauthorized extraction of sensitive labor data from the NLRB by DOGE, the importance for understanding the historical trajectory of union membership have never been higher.

## Describe the data set you wish to explore: 
I wish to explore union membership across their highest education, industry, gender, and whether their profession is in a public or private sector.

## Describe observations in the data: 
The data spans from 1973 to 2024 and consists of union workers. 

## General descriptions of the variables: There are 10 variables: 
year, union membership, gender, highest education, private, public sector, and industry.
