Project 3
---
Here contains a reproducible Quarto report (project3_draft.qmd), cleaned datasets for union membership analysis by education, gender, industry, and sector, R scripts for data preparation and modeling, and saved plots used in the exploratory data analysis and initial modeling results.

## Reproducibility
All data files required to reproduce the analysis are located in the [/data](https://github.com/nalucasucsc/stat155/tree/main/Project%201/Data) folder in Project 1. All generated plots are saved in the [/Plots](https://github.com/nalucasucsc/stat155/tree/main/Project%202/Plots) folder in Project 2. To reproduce the analysis, open [project3_draft.qmd](https://github.com/nalucasucsc/stat155/blob/main/Project%203/project3_draft.qmd) and run the document. Ensure that the working directory is set to the root of the [Project 3](https://github.com/nalucasucsc/stat155/tree/main/Project%203) folder.
