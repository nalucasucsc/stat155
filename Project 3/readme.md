Project 3
---
Here contains a reproducible Quarto report (project3_draft.qmd), cleaned datasets for union membership analysis by education, gender, industry, and sector, R scripts for data preparation and modeling, and saved plots used in the exploratory data analysis and initial modeling results.

## Reproducibility
All data files required to reproduce the analysis are located in the `/data` folder in Project 1. All generated plots are saved in the `/Plots` folder in Project 2. To reproduce the analysis, open `project3_draft.qmd` and run the document. Ensure that the working directory is set to the root of the Project 3 folder.
